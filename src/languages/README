Commit-Digest Language Translations
-----------------------------------
These language subdirectories only store the compiled .MO string files,
which allows the Commit-Digest interface to be used by end users in 
different languages, but means that changes/additions to translation 
strings are not able to be made from here.
 
This is intentional.
Translations for Commit-Digest are done in the KDE subversion repository, in
/trunk/l10n-kde4/templates/messages/others/
