                    <p>
                      Hi everybody,
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      My name is Andreas Schilling. I am a research assistant at the chair of Information Systems and Services at Bamberg University.<br />
                      In my research, I examine why developers stay committed in their open-source projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Could you please give me some quick feedback about your motivation and your experiences at KDE?<br />
                      I am asking you because the best way to find out more about the factors which really matter to open-source developers is to ask them directly.<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For your feedback, please fill out the questions on the following pages â€“ it will not take you more than 10 minutes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You may be rewarded if you participate in this survey! From all survey participants (who have fully answered all questions), one random person will win the current Google Nexus 4 phone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As soon as I finish my research, I will publish a blog post with the aggregated results of this survey, and I will compare them with the results of other surveys (such as with Google Summer of Code participants).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you have any questions about this questionnaire or about my research, please do not hesitate to contact me directly (<a href="mailto:andreas.schilling@uni-bamberg.de">andreas.schilling@uni-bamberg.de</a>).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I would like to wish all of you the best for your coding projects at KDE.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Best Regards,<br />
                      Andreas Schilling
